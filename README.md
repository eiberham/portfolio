# Portfolio

This is a simple layout and a practice i did using gatsby (the static site generator), react (obviously), flexbox and css grid to build a developer page, where a short self description and a contact page can be modified to our needs to have some presence on the web.

In this case for the form submission a contact form to email service called formspree was used, it's easy to set up and requires no registration in order to work.

For form validation the formik package was used and work wonders.
